This directory should contain image files for testing.

For example:
- channel_avatar.png
- profile.png
- channel_banner.jpg

Since we can't upload actual image files through this interface, you'll need to manually add image files to this directory.

For testing purposes, you can use any image file and rename it to match the filenames used in the mock data.
