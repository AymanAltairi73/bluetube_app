This directory should contain thumbnail images for testing.

For example:
- flutter_3.jpg
- clean_architecture.jpg
- getx.jpg
- flutter_performance.jpg
- material_3.jpg
- riverpod.jpg
- state_management.jpg
- flutter_web.jpg
- dart_3.jpg
- flutter_testing.jpg

Since we can't upload actual image files through this interface, you'll need to manually add image files to this directory.

For testing purposes, you can use any JPG file and rename it to match the filenames used in the mock data.
