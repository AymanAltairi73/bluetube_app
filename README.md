# BlueTube App

A Flutter application that demonstrates Clean Architecture principles with a YouTube-like interface.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Overview

**BlueTube** is a cross-platform mobile application built with **Flutter** (Dart) that mimics YouTube‚Äôs core user experience. The app is structured using Clean Architecture, ensuring a modular, maintainable, and scalable codebase.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The project is organized into three main layers:

- **Presentation Layer**  
  UI widgets, screens, controllers, and state management.
- **Domain Layer**  
  Business logic, use cases, entities, and repository interfaces.
- **Data Layer**  
  Data sources, repository implementations, and models.

This separation of concerns allows for easy testing, flexibility, and code reuse.

## ‚ú® Features

- Home feed with video recommendations
- Powerful video search functionality
- Video playback with advanced controls
- Shorts (short-form videos)
- User library and subscriptions
- Video comments and interactive features
- "Watch Later" and downloads functionality
- User authentication (mocked)
- Clean, responsive, and modern UI

---

## üìÅ Mock Data Implementation

BlueTube uses local JSON files as mock data sources to simulate API interactions. This enables offline development and testing without needing an actual YouTube API key.

**Sample Mock Data Files:**

- `search_results.json`: Search results
- `video_details.json`: Video details
- `trending_videos.json`: Trending videos
- `comments.json`: Comments section
- `related_videos.json`: Related videos
- `categories.json`: Video categories
- `videos_by_category.json`: Category-specific videos
- `channel_details.json`: Channel information

## üßπ Recent Cleanup and Optimization

BlueTube‚Äôs codebase has recently been refactored and optimized for maintainability:

- **Redundant Files Removed:**
  - Duplicate `app_routes.dart` file eliminated
  - Unused API implementation code removed

- **Configuration Improvements:**
  - Enhanced `ApiConfig` with network simulation parameters
  - Centralized configuration values for consistency

- **Code Structure:**
  - Local data sources now utilize centralized config
  - Improved organization and documentation

- **Dependency Cleanup:**
  - Removed unused `share_plus` dependency
